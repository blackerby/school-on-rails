# SimpleCov must be running in the process that you want the code coverage
# analysis to happen on. When testing a server process (e.g. a JSON API endpoint)
# via a separate test process (e.g. when using Selenium) where you want to see all
# code executed by the rails server, and not just code executed in your actual
# test files, you need to require SimpleCov in the server process. For rails for
# instance, you'll want to add something like this to the top of bin/rails, but
# below the "shebang" line (#! /usr/bin/env ruby) and after config/boot is
# required:

if ENV['RAILS_ENV'] == 'test'
  require 'simplecov'
  SimpleCov.start 'rails'
  puts 'required simplecov'
end
